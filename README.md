# Policy Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project is an *Policy Recommendation System** that uses AI/ML models to recommend personalized insurance policies to users based on their demographics and behavior. The system leverages **Decision Tree** and **Collaborative Filtering** algorithms to provide accurate and tailored recommendations.

### Key Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests policies based on user demographics and past interactions.
- **AI/ML Models**: Uses Decision Tree and Collaborative Filtering for policy recommendations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for a seamless user experience.
- **Secure Authentication**: Implements Flask sessions for secure user login and authentication.
- **Scalable Backend**: Powered by Flask (Python) and MySQL for data storage and processing.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS), Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Flask (Python Framework), Jinja2 (Templating Engine)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **AI/ML Models**: Decision Tree, Collaborative Filtering
- **Security**: Flask Sessions for Authentication
